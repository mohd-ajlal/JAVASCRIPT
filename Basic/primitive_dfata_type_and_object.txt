Primitive Data Types: 
                    Primitive data types are a set of basic data types in javascript.
                    
                    There are 7 primitive data types in javascript:
                    1. Number
                    2. null
                    3. Symbol
                    4. String
                    5. Boolean
                    6. BigInt
                    7. undefined
        
Non-Primitive Data Types: 
                    Non-primitive data types are a set of data types in javascript that are not primitive.
                    
Non-Primitive data types refer to objects and hence they are called reference types. Examples of non-primitive types include Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interface, etc.

Object: 
                    An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.
                    In addition to objects that are predefined in the browser, you can define your own objects.

                    Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

                    An object in JavaScript can be created as follows:
                    example:
                    const item = {name: "Bike", price: 100000};
                    where item is the object name, name and price are the properties/keys of the object and "Bike" and 100000 are the values of the properties.

                    Objects are containers for named values called properties or methods.

                    Objects are created using the new keyword.
