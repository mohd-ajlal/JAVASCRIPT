Ecmascript: ECMAScript is a standard on which javascript is based. it was created to ensuire that different documents on javascript are
            actually talking about the same language.

            JavaScript and ECMAScript can almost always be used interchangeably JavaScript is very liberal in what it allows.
            You can do things in JavaScript that would never work in other languages. This is both a blessing and a curse.
